            android:text="Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
\n\n Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.\n\nThere are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.\n\nBeginning with Python programming:
\n\n1) Finding an Interpreter:  Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and run our programs. There are certain online interpreters like https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/ that can be used to run Python programs without installing an interpreter.
\n\nWindows: There are many interpreters available freely to run Python scripts like IDLE (Integrated Development Environment) that comes bundled with the Python software downloaded from http://python.org/.

\n\nLinux: Python comes preinstalled with popular Linux distros such as Ubuntu and Fedora. To check which version of Python you’re running, type “python” in the terminal emulator. The interpreter should start and print the version number.

\n\nmacOS: Generally, Python 2.7 comes bundled with macOS. You’ll have to manually install Python 3 from http://python.org/.
\n\nPython designed by Guido van Rossum at CWI has become a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.

\n\nPrerequisites:

\n\nKnowledge of any programming language can be a plus.

\n\nReason for increasing popularity

\n\nEmphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing
Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.
There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.
Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.
